# cs 451 In Class Exercise: Python Doctest
This exercise is designed to give you a chance, in class, to implement functionality in a given python module then design and implement doctests for the module. 

## Getting Started

1. Fork this project to your repository.
2. Clone **your fork** to your computer.
3. Complete the development tasks listed below then commit and push your changes back up to your GitHub repo.

## Development Tasks: Using Python doctest module
This project one source file containing five functions. One function has an error in its doctest. Three functions require a doctest specification.

### Step 0:
**Run the tests.**

```python -m doctest sample_doctest.py```

Fix the problem with the first doctest.

### Step 1:
Implement the doctests for the functions ```get_evens(n)```, ```get_mid(data)```, and ```get_last_half(data)```.

**Run the tests.**

```python -m doctest sample_doctest.py```

### Step 2:
Commit your changes and push to your remote repository. Let instructor know when your project changes are commited and pushed.
